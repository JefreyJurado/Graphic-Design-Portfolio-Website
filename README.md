Jefrey Jurado Portfolio — Milestone 1 (HTML + CSS)
Overview

This is the first draft of my portfolio website. It’s built using HTML and CSS and follows the wireframe layout I designed.

The goal here was to set up the structure and basic styling for the website. Later milestones will add more interactive features with Bootstrap and JavaScript.

The website includes:

-Hero section
-About Me
-Featured Projects
-Skills & Testimonials
-Contact
-Footer
