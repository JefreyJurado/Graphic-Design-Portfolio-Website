      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m Jefrey, a passionate <b>Graphic Designer & Developer</b> who loves blending creativity with functionality. 
        With experience in branding, layout design, and front-end development, I bring ideas to life through 
        bold visuals and clean, user-friendly websites. I enjoy working with design tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, 
        and Figma, and I’m constantly learning new technologies to stay ahead in the digital space.</p>

        <br><p>When I’m not designing or coding, you’ll find me exploring creative trends, learning new skills, and 
        collaborating on projects that make a meaningful impact. My goal is to deliver designs that not only 
        look good but also communicate effectively and connect with people.</p>
